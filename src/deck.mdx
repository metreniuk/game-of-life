  to work on the so-called Manhattan Project.
  The purpose of the project was to solve national security challenges through scientific excellence.
  The scientific lead of the project was John von Neumann.

  He was the kind of scientist that does science for the sake of the science even if he is supposed 
  to work on a secret military project. 
  He was interested in a machine that could create itself from the ground. 
  He called it **universal constructor**. Having lots of brilliant ideas but lacking tools 
  to put them in practice he stumbled on the works of his colleague.

  At that time Stanislaw Ulam discovered that he can find answers 
  to non-trivial questions simulating them on a computer (quite innovative at that time). 
  Spending time together and discussing problems that both of them 
were interested in, they discovered a whole new field in mathematics called **cellular automata**.
