During World War II the U.S. gathered a bunch of brilliant scientists
to work on the so-called Manhattan Project.
The purpose of the project was to solve national security challenges through scientific excellence.
The scientific lead of the project was John von Neumann.

<TextWrapper>

He was the kind of scientist that does science for the sake of the science even if he is supposed
to work on a secret military project.
He was interested in a machine that could create itself from the ground.
He called it **universal constructor**. Having lots of brilliant ideas but lacking tools
to put them in practice he stumbled on the works of his colleague.

</TextWrapper>

<TextWrapper>

At that time Stanislaw Ulam discovered that he can find answers
to non-trivial questions simulating them on a computer (quite innovative at that time).
Spending time together and discussing problems that both of them
were interested in, they discovered a whole new field in mathematics called **cellular automata**.

</TextWrapper>

---

import { Cell } from "./Cell"
import { HorizontalCenter, Finger } from "./wrappers"

**Cellular automata** is basically a grid of _cells_ that can be
in different states, for example, _on_ or _off_.
Let say that if a cell is _on_
we will consider it a **live** cell.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <Cell alive size={60} />
</HorizontalCenter>

If a cell is _off_ we will consider it **dead**.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <Cell size={60} />
</HorizontalCenter>
---

Inspired by this idea, in 1968 John Conway began to experiment with defining some rules for cellular automata that should meet the following criteria:

1. There should be no explosive growth. The grid should not be filled very quickly (we will get in a moment _why_).
1. There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
1. There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors (the machine that can create itself).
1. The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.

---

import { Grid, NextWorld } from "./Grid"

Let's discover what rules Conway formalized trying to create the life from scratch.
But first, we will define some concepts that will help us move forward.
You are already familiar with the **cell** and its two states: **live** and **dead**.

<HorizontalCenter style={{ flexDirection: "column", alignItems: "center" }}>
  <NextWorld world={[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]}>
    {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => <Grid size={50} {...worldAndHandlers} />}
  </NextWorld>
  <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger> <small style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>(hover)</small>
</HorizontalCenter>

Since we have a two-dimensional grid each **cell** has **neighbors**.
Each **neighbor** can also be **live** or **dead**.

---

John Conway came up with the following rules.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors **dies**, as if by _underpopulation_.

<HorizontalCenter justify="space-around">
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[1, 1]]} willDie {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[0, 0], [2, 2]]} willDie {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>

  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.

<HorizontalCenter justify="space-around">
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[1, 1]]} {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>

  </div>
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[1, 1]]} {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>

---

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors **dies**, as if by _overpopulation_.

<HorizontalCenter justify="space-around">
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[1, 1]]} willDie {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid
          size={60}
          specialCells={[[1, 0], [1, 1]]}
          willDie
          {...worldAndHandlers}
        />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a **live** cell, as if by _reproduction_.

<HorizontalCenter justify="space-around">
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid size={60} specialCells={[[1, 1]]} {...worldAndHandlers} />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
  <div>
    <NextWorld world={[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]}>
      {({ ...worldAndHandlers }) => (
        <Grid
          size={60}
          specialCells={[[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]]}
          {...worldAndHandlers}
        />
      )}
    </NextWorld>
    <Finger>ðŸ‘†</Finger>
  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>

These rules are trying to achieve balance in the life of the _cellular automata_ by following the [initial requirements](/#5):

- The fact that a cell can die surrounded by a certain number of neighbors assures that the world will not have an explosive growth.
- The rules have the potential to generate some unpredictable outcomes (you will see different sort of things that can be achieved in the "game of life").
- The rules are quite simple.

  A careful reader can see that I didn't mention the _universal constructor_. This is on purpose, we will get there at the end of the road, I promise.

  Alright! We have four simple rules, a bunch of cells and our imagination! Take some time to play with a small group of cells (if you want to skip, feel free to discover more interesting stuff).

---

import { Table } from "./Table"

<Table rows={11} cols={11} cellSize={44} />

---

import { LivingWorld } from "./Grid"

A world that has only cells is not enough. We need a more sophisticated form of life.
If you "played" enough time with the game of life you can discover interesting shapes that come up again and again.
If not, let me show. Let's try this shape together.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <LivingWorld world={[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]}>
    {({ world }) => <Grid size={60} world={world} />}
  </LivingWorld>
</HorizontalCenter>

If by _chance_ the cells are getting this shape they will forever be stuck in this behavior.
This kind of behaviors we can call _patterns_ or _organisms_.
This specific one is called a "blinker" (guess why).
There are more patterns that you will encounter while _playing life_.
Here are a few more.

These patterns seem interesting but they lack some _real_ life. We need some movement.
We need some _life_! Let me introduce you...(drum roll) the **glider**!
How is the glider different from the blinker or the toad?
The glider is a curious fella! He traverses the world looking for adventures,
until encounters other cells that could hurt him.
