  During World War II the U.S. gathered a bunch of brilliant scientists 
  to work on the so-called Manhattan Project.
  The purpose of the project was to solve national security challenges through scientific excellence.
  The scientific lead of the project was John von Neumann.

  He was the kind of scientist that does science for the sake of the science even if he is supposed 
  to work on a secret military project. 
  He was interested in a machine that could create itself from the ground. 
  He called it **universal constructor**. Having lots of brilliant ideas but lacking tools 
  to put them in practice he stumbled on the works of his colleague.

  At that time Stanislaw Ulam discovered that he can find answers 
  to non-trivial questions simulating them on a computer (quite innovative at that time). 
  Spending time together and discussing problems that both of them 
were interested in, they discovered a whole new field in mathematics called **cellular automata**.

import {Cell} from './Cell'
import {HorizontalCenter} from "./wrappers"

**Cellular automata** is basically a grid of _cells_ that can be 
in different states, for example, _on_ or _off_. 
Let say that if a cell is _on_
we will consider it **alive**.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <Cell alive size={60} />
</HorizontalCenter>

If a cell is _off_ we will consider it **dead**.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <Cell size={60} />
</HorizontalCenter>

Inspired by this idea, in 1968 John Conway began to experiment with defining some rules for cellular automata that should meet the following criteria:

1. There should be no explosive growth. The grid should not be filled very quickly (we will get in a moment _why_).
1. There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
1. There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors (the machine that can create itself).
1. The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.

import {Grid} from './Grid'

Let's discover what rules Conway formalized trying to create the life from scratch.
But first, we will define some concepts that will help us move forward. 
You are already familiar with the **cell** and its two states: **alive** and **dead**.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <Grid size={50} world={[
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1],
    ]} 
  />
</HorizontalCenter>

Since we have a two-dimensional grid each **cell** have **neighbors**. 
Each **neighbor** can also be **alive** or **dead**.

John Conway came up with the following rules.

1. Any living cell with fewer than two live neighbors **dies**, as if by **underpopulation**.

<HorizontalCenter >
  <div>
    <Grid size={60} world={[
      [0, 0, 0],
      [0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 0],
      ]}
    />
    <p style={{fontSize: 14}}>(^^ hover ^^)</p>
  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>

2. Any living cell with two or three alive neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.

<HorizontalCenter>
  <div>
    <Grid size={60} world={[
      [0, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 0],
      [1, 0, 0],
      ]}
    />
    <p style={{fontSize: 14}}>(^^ hover ^^)</p>
  </div>
</HorizontalCenter>
